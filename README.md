## JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures(Beta)
- Building a Pyramid Generator: let/const variables, pop/push/unshift/shift arrays, loops, .repeat function for strings, functions, truthy and falsy values, and strict equality
- Gradebook App: A few basic functions such as averaging numbers and returning a string from a conditionals checking for number ranges
- Role Playing Game: connecting js to html/css, arrays as objects, document.querySelector for accessing html in js, button onclick property, innerText property for changing text, objects, screen update function, innerHTML property for using js to modify html, and ternary operators
- Random Background Color Changer: debugging
- Calorie Counter: getElementById method for grabbing html info, cleaning input, regex with character classes and flags, .replace method, .match method for regex, value property, template literals for interpolating variables within a string, innerHTML property, addEventListener method, insertAdjacentHTML method for preserving input content, submit event, and preventDefault method
- Rock, Paper, Scissors: DOM Manipulation
- Music Player: web audio API, spread operator for copying elements into an array, arrow functions for anonymous function expression and function shorthand, map method for iterating through an array and returning a new array, join method for joining an array into a single string, optional chaining for preventing errors accessing null properties, array class methods, for each method, createElement DOM method for dynamically creating elements
***
- Date Formatter: Date object, using constructors, change event for listening for html element change, switches, split join reverse methods
- Soccer Cards: Object.freeze method for preventing changes, object destructuring syntax for unpacking values from arrays and objects
- Todo App: Allowing data to persist by storing as key:value pair with LocalStorage, toggle method for adding/removing classes from elements, modal methods for working with a modal dialog box, Date.now method for returning epoch time, modify arrays while returning removed elements with splice method, resolving local storage issues with JSON.stringify method to convert to string format and JSON.parse to work with object format
- Binary Converter: logging event objects for the keydown event using the key property, casting a string into an integer with the parseInt method, recursion, running asynchronous code using the setTimeout function
***
- Spam Filter: matching input with regex expressions and the test method, match either or values with alternate sequence |, some method for checking for at least one true element, capture a group of a regex expression to save for later reference, extensive regex usage
- Number Sorter: bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, sort method
- Statistics Calculator: filter out input using the filter method, apply a function to condense an array into a single value using the reduce method, sorting numbers using the sort method with parameters a and b and returning a - b, tracking values using a set to prevent duplicate values
- Spreadsheet: define the behavior of the window when loaded with the unload property of the window object, convert strings and numbers with charCodeAt and String.fromCharCode methods, introduced to the concept of currying or returning a function within a function, check a callback function to be true for all elements in an array with the every method
***
- Shopping Cart: using objects and classes to structure code through object-oriented programming, referencing the current instance of an object using the this keyword, clean up decimal number formatting with the toFixed method, display a confirmation prompt using the confirm method
- Platformer Game: create graphics with the canvas API, updating animation on a screen with the requestAnimationFrame API, assigning multiple conditions to run the same code in a switch
- Dice Game: updating UI dynamically based on game state
***
- Author Page: fetch data from an external API and dynamically update the DOM, paginate data so results can be loaded in batches
- Forum Leaderboard: use asynchronous operations to execute tasks independently of the main program flow, handle errors with a try…catch statement

## Front End Development Libraries
